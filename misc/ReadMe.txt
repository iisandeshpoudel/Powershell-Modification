FAQ
Q. What's changed now?
A. Your PowerShell is now beautiful, new Predictive IntelliSense has been added,
and now you can use the z module.


Q. What's Predictive IntelliSense?
A. Predictive IntelliSense is a feature in PowerShell that suggests code completions and parameter values based on context
and usage patterns. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze your code and predict what you might want to type next.
When you start typing a command or parameter, Predictive IntelliSense will suggest the most likely options based on
the context and patterns in your code. This can save you time by reducing the amount of typing you need to do and by
reducing errors due to typos or incorrect parameter values.

Q. What's z module?
A. The z module is a PowerShell module that provides fast directory jumping
(i.e., changing the current working directory to a previously visited directory) by maintaining a list of the
most frequently and recently visited directories.
When you use the z module, you can use the z command followed by a partial directory name to quickly
switch to the most frequently or recently visited directory that matches the name you provided.

For example, if you frequently visit the directory C:\Users\JohnDoe\Documents\MyScripts,
you can use the command z MyScripts to quickly switch to that directory from anywhere in the file system.
